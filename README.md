FairBet contract code repository, suitable for EVM chains.

## Overview

FairBet V2.0 is a deposit mode prediction platform. Users need to deposit corresponding tokens into FairBet's contract before participating in the prediction game. When participating in the product in the future, they only need to send signature information and do not need to interact on the chain every time. This can enhance user experience and save gas fees, thereby facilitating and attracting users to participate in prediction games.
